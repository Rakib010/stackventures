- Store, Actions, Reducers
- What is the role of the Redux store? How do you create one?
- What is an action in Redux? Provide an example.
- What is a reducer in Redux? Write a simple reducer function.
- Explain the Redux data flow (unidirectional data flow).
- What is an action creator? Why use them?
